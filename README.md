# 🌸 Iris Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing

This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline using the **Iris dataset**, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It is ideal for beginners to learn foundational concepts in data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and preparation for machine learning.

## 📂 Project Overview

In this notebook-based project, we walk through the essential steps of understanding and preparing the Iris dataset for machine learning tasks. These include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Missing value imputation**
- **Outlier detection and treatment**
- **Feature scaling and normalization**
- **Data visualization techniques**
- **Skewness and standard deviation analysis**

## 📈 Dataset Description

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species:
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

Each observation includes four numerical features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Additionally, a categorical column `Species` defines the class label.

## 🛠️ What This Project Covers

### 1. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset**
- Basic summary and structure
- Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Initial data visualization (histograms and boxplots)

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
- Simulated missing values in both numeric and categorical columns
- Filled:
  - Numeric using **median** (robust against outliers)
  - Categorical using **mode**

### 3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**
- Used **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method and **Z-score**
- Applied **capping** (clipping) for numeric outliers using IQR limits

### 4. **Skewness & Standard Deviation**
- Measured skewness to understand data distribution
- Calculated standard deviation for spread analysis

### 5. **Normalization Techniques**
- **Z-score Normalization (Standardization)** using `StandardScaler`
- **Min-Max Normalization** using `MinMaxScaler`
- Compared effects visually using **Seaborn Pairplots**

### 6. **Data Visualization**
- Pairplots before and after normalization
- Histograms and boxplots for visual insight into distribution and outliers

## 📌 Why These Steps Are Necessary

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** helps understand the data distribution, identify issues, and form hypotheses.
- **Missing Value Treatment** ensures model robustness by avoiding null-induced errors.
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment** minimizes distortion in statistical calculations and ML training.
- **Normalization** is essential for distance-based models (e.g., KNN, SVM) and gradient-based optimizers.
- **Visualization** aids interpretability and communicates patterns, trends, and anomalies effectively.
